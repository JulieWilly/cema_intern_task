# Application installatioin procedure
 - Clone the project in your local folder.
 - Open the project with an editor that suites you.
 - Open terminal and install node packages.
 - run the application
 
        ~ To run the application, move to client folder and run the command bash npm run dev 
        This will run the front-end of the application.
        ~ To run the server, open another  terminal and move to the server folder, run the cammand npm run start. 
        This will run the server

- Having successfully done this, you can carry out multiple CRUD operations in the application.



# Software Engineering Intern Task
## Write a short program that simulates a basic health information system for managing clients
and health programs/services.
Your solution should allow a doctor (system user) to do the following:
 1. Create a health program – e.g., TB, Malaria, HIV, etc.
2. Register a new client in the system.
3. Enroll a client in one or more programs.
4. Search for a client from a list of registered clients.
5. View a client&#39;s profile, including the programs they are enrolled in.
6. Expose the client profile via an API, so that other systems can retrieve this information.

### Please ensure that your code is clean, well-documented, and easy to understand.
Submission:
1. Provide a Github link of your repository for review.
2. Include a PowerPoint presentation on the approach, design and the solution
3. Include a prototype demonstration
