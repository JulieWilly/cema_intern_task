# Software Engineering Intern Task
## Write a short program that simulates a basic health information system for managing clients
and health programs/services.
Your solution should allow a doctor (system user) to do the following:
 1. Create a health program – e.g., TB, Malaria, HIV, etc.
2. Register a new client in the system.
3. Enroll a client in one or more programs.
4. Search for a client from a list of registered clients.
5. View a client&#39;s profile, including the programs they are enrolled in.
6. Expose the client profile via an API, so that other systems can retrieve this information.

### Please ensure that your code is clean, well-documented, and easy to understand.
Submission:
1. Provide a Github link of your repository for review.
2. Include a PowerPoint presentation on the approach, design and the solution
3. Include a prototype demonstration
